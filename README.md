bb.css (pronounced *ˈbibi si ɛs ɛs*) is a bare bones css framework.

## Motivation

To create a minimalist css framework that is:

* similar to pure.css,
* much smaller than bootstrap,
* uses flexbox instead of grids, and
* doesn't require classes

## Installation

Drop bb.css in your css folder. Link to bb.css in your html head.

```
#!html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
```
