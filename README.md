bb.css (pronounced *ˈbibi si ɛs ɛs*) is a bare bones css framework.

## Motivation

To create a minimalist css framework that is:

* similar to pure.css,
* much smaller than bootstrap,
* uses flexbox instead of grids, and
* doesn't require classes

## Installation

Drop bb.css in your css folder. Link to bb.css in your html head.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bb.css">
```

Worried about cross-browser support? Try [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

If you would the same nice fonts and icons, bb.css uses [Source Pro](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Source&selection.family=Source+Code+Pro|Source+Sans+Pro|Source+Serif+Pro) family and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
